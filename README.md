# Ken's Portfolio Website

I made a portfolio website to display my past projects and to allow people to easily get in contact with me.

Visitors are able to click on the projects which opens the project in a new tab. They are also able to click on the social-media icons to get easily linked.

I really enjoyed making this project.
